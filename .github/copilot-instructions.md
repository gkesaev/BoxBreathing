# Copilot Instructions

## Project
React box breathing app with Vite + shadcn/ui. 4-4-4-4 breathing technique for relaxation.

## Commits
**Required:** Use semantic commits: `<type>: <description>`
- `feat:` new features
- `fix:` bug fixes
- `docs:` documentation
- `style:` formatting
- `refactor:` code cleanup
- `test:` tests
- `chore:` maintenance

## Code
- TypeScript functional components with hooks
- Avoid `any`, use proper typing
- Components in `src/components/`, one per file
- Group imports: React → third-party → local
- **No unnecessary comments**: Use descriptive variable/function names instead
- Only comment when logic is inherently complex or non-obvious

## App-Specific
- 4-second breathing phases with smooth animations
- Accessible (keyboard nav, ARIA labels, reduced motion)
- Mobile responsive
- Calm, soothing design
